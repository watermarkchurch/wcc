# WCC

This gem holds the base namespace and default configuration for
Watermark Community Church's Ruby development. This is kind of the
general repository for common code between different apps. As components
begin to emerge in this code base they should be extracted into a
separate gem. This should be a breeding ground for new gems.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'wcc-base'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wcc-base
